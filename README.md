# SwiftUIAudio_RecordAndPlay

This is a fairly simple example of how to Record and Play audio files. Feel free to use it as you wish at your own risk.

Many of the ideas and some of the code was inspired by the work of Devanshu Chandhary in his gitlab repo at https://github.com/devdchaudhary/VoiceRecorderKit.  I simplified it to make it easier to understand the fundamentals of recording and playing audio files.
